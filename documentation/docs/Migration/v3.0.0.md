Only the compose module has been changed like following:

* all `<function>Mapped(...)` functions have been removed - they are no longer needed as the a replaced with `<function>(...)` function overloads with a `mapper` parameter.
* all functions with an `apply` parameter have been removed - if you need them use the overloads with the `mapper` parameter instead, those are more flexible as they also allow you to convert the data type.
* `lifecycle` functions have been moved from `androidMain` to `commonMain` - they are now available for all platforms

The reason why I made a changing break update is mostly the last point - moving lifecycle functions to `commonMain` breaks the compatibility with previous versions. So I also made the clean up of removing the mapped functions and apply parameters while I was at it.
